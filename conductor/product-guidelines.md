# Product Guidelines: Zik Lodge Finder

## 1. Visual Identity
*   **Style:** Clean, modern, and trustworthy. The design should feel approachable for students yet professional enough for landlords.
*   **Layout:** Mobile-first approach. High priority on responsiveness and touch targets, as many users will access the platform via smartphones.
*   **Iconography:** Consistent use of outlines or filled icons (e.g., Lucide React) to represent actions and categories clearly.

## 2. Color Palette
*   **Primary:** A distinct color (e.g., a shade of Blue or Green) used for primary actions (buttons, links) and branding elements to convey trust and reliability.
*   **Secondary:** Neutral tones (Grays, Whites) for backgrounds and cards to keep the content readable and the interface uncluttered.
*   **Semantic:** Standard colors for status feedback:
    *   **Success:** Green (e.g., Request sent, Listing updated).
    *   **Error:** Red (e.g., Validation errors, Deletion warnings).
    *   **Warning:** Yellow/Orange (e.g., Pending verification).

## 3. Typography
*   **Font Family:** Modern Sans-Serif (e.g., Geist, Inter, or system fonts) to ensure maximum legibility across devices.
*   **Hierarchy:** Clear distinction between headings (listing titles), subheadings (sections), and body text (descriptions). Use font weight and size to guide the user's eye.

## 4. User Experience (UX) Principles
*   **Simplicity:** Minimize the number of steps required to perform key actions (e.g., contacting a landlord or searching for a lodge).
*   **Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback for all user interactions (loading states, toast notifications for success/error).
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast ratios and proper ARIA labels for interactive elements.
*   **Performance:** Optimize image loading (using Cloudinary and Next.js Image) to ensure fast page loads, even on slower networks.

## 5. Content & Tone
*   **Voice:** Professional, helpful, and direct.
*   **Clarity:** Use simple language. Avoid jargon. Ensure error messages are descriptive and actionable.
