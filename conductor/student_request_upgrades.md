# Student Request Function Upgrades (TODO)

This document tracks planned improvements for the "Lodge Request" system where students notify the community of their housing needs.

## 1. The "Landlord Interest" Loop
- **Feature**: Add an **"I have a match"** button for landlords on every student request in the Market.
- **Trigger**: Landlord clicks the button.
- **Action**: Student receives a notification: *"Landlord [Name] has a lodge that matches your request! [Link to Lodge]"*.
- **Value**: Incentivizes landlords to proactively reach out to qualified leads.

## 2. Request Expiry & Auto-Cleanup
- **Feature**: Automatic unpublishing of requests after a set duration (e.g., 7 or 14 days).
- **Trigger**: Request age exceeds limit.
- **Action**: Mark request as inactive and notify the student: *"Your request has expired. Click here to renew it if you are still searching."*
- **Value**: Keeps the Market fresh and reduces calls to students who have already moved.

## 3. "Smart Match" Scoring
- **Feature**: Introduction of detailed request tags (e.g., "Max Budget," "Upstairs Only," "Steady Light").
- **Action**: Display a compatibility percentage to landlords (e.g., *"90% Match for your lodge 'Precious Villa'"*).
- **Value**: Helps landlords prioritize which students to contact first based on lodge compatibility.

## 4. Student Request Analytics
- **Feature**: A "My Requests" dashboard for students.
- **Metrics**: Show "View Count" (how many landlords saw the request) and "Lead Count" (how many landlords clicked the phone number).
- **Value**: Provides feedback to students on their request performance (e.g., if views are high but calls are low, their budget might be too restrictive).

## 5. Multi-Location & Budget Ranges
- **Feature**: Allow students to select multiple areas (e.g., Ifite and Amansea) and set a budget range (Min to Max).
- **Value**: Reflects actual student behavior and increases the matching pool for landlords.

## 6. "Found a Lodge" (Fulfilled Status)
- **Feature**: A simple "Mark as Fulfilled" button for students.
- **Action**: Immediately hide the request and the student's contact details from the public view.
- **Value**: Protects student privacy and prevents unnecessary calls once they are settled.
