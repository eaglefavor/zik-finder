# Product Guide: ZikLodge

## # Initial Concept
ZikLodge is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of finding and managing off-campus accommodation (lodges). It connects tenants (likely students) with landlords, providing a secure and efficient way to list, search for, and rent properties.

## 1. Problem Statement
Finding suitable off-campus housing can be stressful and fragmented, often relying on word-of-mouth or unverified agents. Landlords struggle with managing listings and verifying tenants. This platform aims to centralize these interactions, offering transparency and ease of use for both parties.

## 2. Target Audience
*   **Tenants (Students/Individuals):** Users looking for accommodation. They need search filters, detailed lodge information, and a way to save favorites or request visits.
*   **Landlords/Agents:** Users who own or manage properties. They need tools to list lodges, upload photos, and manage tenant interest.
*   **Administrators:** Platform overseers who manage user verification, content moderation, and overall system health.

## 3. Core Value Proposition
*   **Centralized Marketplace:** A single hub for all available lodges in the area.
*   **Verified Listings:** Mechanisms (like selfie verification/admin checks) to reduce fraud.
*   **Direct Connection:** Facilitates direct communication or structured requests between tenants and landlords.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Modern, responsive design for easy navigation on mobile and desktop.

## 4. Key Features
*   **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up/login for all user types (Supabase Auth).
*   **Lodge Management:** Landlords can create, update, and delete lodge listings with photos (Cloudinary) and details.
*   **Advanced Search:** Tenants can search for lodges based on criteria (location, price, amenities).
*   **Favorites:** Ability for users to save lodges they are interested in.
*   **Requests System:** A workflow for tenants to express interest or apply for a lodge.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Tools for admins to view usage stats and manage users/content.
*   **Profile Management:** Users can manage their personal details and security settings.

## 5. Success Metrics
*   Number of active listings.
*   Number of successful tenant-landlord connections/requests.
*   User growth and retention.
